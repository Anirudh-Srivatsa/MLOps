# The strftime() function is a Python function that is used to format a date and time object into a string. It takes a date/time object and a format string as arguments, and returns a string representing the date/time in the specified format.
#os.getcwd(): This gets the current working directory (the directory where your Python script is being executed).
#os.path.join(): This combines the current working directory, the "logs" directory, and the LOG_FILE name into a complete file path for the log file. For example, it could be something like D:\2.0\Project_2.0\MLOps\logs\08_16_2024_10_22_30.log.
#If the "logs" directory doesn't exist in the current working directory, os.path.join() will create it automatically when the path is constructed.

format="[ %(asctime)s ] %(lineno)d %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s": This defines the format for log messages. Hereâ€™s what each placeholder means:
%(asctime)s: Timestamp when the log entry was created.
%(lineno)d: Line number in the source code where the log call was made.
%(name)s: Name of the logger.
%(levelname)s: Severity level of the log (e.g., INFO, ERROR).
%(message)s: The actual log message.'''

'''
The if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to ensure that the code inside it runs only when the script is executed directly and not when it is imported as a module in another script.
In your case, "Logging has started" will be logged when the script is run directly, but it won't be logged if the script is imported elsewhere.
